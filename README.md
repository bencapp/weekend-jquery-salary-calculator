Salary Calculator Using JQuery

## Description

This project wsa for practice getting and setting DOM elements using jquery. The idea was to add and remove elements from the DOM as the user inputs data into the given input fields. I primarily focused on using the "event, state, render" model, which helps to keep the code organized and efficient.
